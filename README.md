### 📌 Pinned Repositories
#### [MoneyBot-Automated-Bots-NetWork](https://github.com/RanWurm/MoneyBot-protected-)
This project is an open-source automated trading bot integrating Telegram, WhatsApp, and web platforms. Entirely developed in Python using asyncio, Selenium, Telethon, and Flask, the bot continuously detects trading signals, automates precise trades, and enforces risk management through loss limits and real-time tracking. Additionally, I collect data on various traders, perform offline statistical analysis, and leverage these insights to determine an optimal strategy for each trade
